            Git and GitHub are two technologies that every developer should
            learn, irrespective of their field.Git is a version control system
            that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not limited to using Git just for source code files you can
            also use it to keep track of text files or even images. This means
            that Git is not just for developers anyone can find it helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git
            repositories. It is a code hosting platform for version control and
            collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from
            anywhere.Imagine working on a project at home and while you are
            away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly remember the solution
            to a code error that has kept you restless for days. You cannot make
            these changes because your PC is not with you. But if you have your
            project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project
            with a command on whatever computer you have access to. Then you can
            make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform.
            Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to
            collaborate with other developers from any location.

          <p>
            In order to use git, you should first install git. Git is easily
            available on the internet.You can download it for your operating
            system from the options given.

          <p>
            After you install git, the next thing you'll need to do is to set
            your username and email address on the command line or command
            interface. Git will use this information to identify who made
            specific changes to files.
          </p>
          <p>
            To set your username, type and execute these commands:
            <code> git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME" </code> and
            <code>git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL".</code>Just make
            sure to replace <code>"YOUR_USERNAME"</code> and
            <code>"YOUR_EMAIL"</code> with the values you choose.

            <h3>How to create and initialize a project in git</h3>
          </header>

          <p>
            First to create a project I would like to suggest you to download
            Visual Studio Code in your desktop.It is a code editor which has an
            inbuilt terminal for executing commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing VS Code, open your project in the editor and open a
            new terminal for your project. This automatically points the
            terminal/command line to your project's path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now to initialize your project, simply run
            <code> git init. </code>This will tell Git to get ready to start
            watching your files for every change that occurs. It looks like
            this:
          </p>
          <img src="img/Screenshot_47.png" alt="gitinit" class="gitinit" />
          <p>
            The first line has information about my PC and the path to where the
            folder exists and also the command <code> git init </code> , and the
            second line is the response sent back telling me that my repository
            (repo) has been initialized. It is considered empty because we have
            not told Git what files to track.
          </p>

          <header id="push_a_repository">
            <h3>How to push a repository to GitHub</h3>
          </header>

          <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 1: Create a Github account</h4>
            <p>You need to create a account of Github first.</p>
            <h4>Step 2: Create a repository</h4>
            <p>
              You can click on the <code>+</code> sign on the top corner and
              then choose on the "New repository". Give your repo a name and
              click on the "Create a repository" button.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3:Adding and Committing files</h4>
            <p>
              <b>Add files:</b>
              When we first initialized our project, the file was not being
              tracked by Git. To do that, we use this command
              <code>git add .</code>To know what state your file is in, you can
              run the <code> git status </code> command.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Commit files:</b>To commit our file, we use the
              <code>git commit -m "first commit"</code> command.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4:Push the repository to github</h4>
            <p>
              After you create the repo, you should be redirected to a page that
              tells you how to create a repo locally or push an existing one.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our case, the project already exists locally so we will use
              commands in the "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command
              line" section. These are the commands:
            </p>
            <div class="block">
              <code>
                <span>git add README.md </span>
                <span> git commit -m "first commit" </span>
                <span> git branch -M main </span>
                <span>
                  git remote add origin https://github.com/asmriti/hi.git
                </span>
                <span>git push -u origin main </span>
              </code>
            </div>
            <h4>Step 5: To add</h4>
            <p>
              After we make changes to the file, we again need to add the file
              to our existing repository. So for that, again on the command
              interface we need to command the following:
            </p>
            <code>
              <span>git add .</span>
              <span>git commit -m "Initial Commit"</span>
              <span>git push origin main</span>
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
