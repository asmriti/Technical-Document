            Git and GitHub are two technologies that every developer should
            learn, irrespective of their field.Git is a version control system
            that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not limited to using Git just for source code files you can
            also use it to keep track of text files or even images. This means
            that Git is not just for developers anyone can find it helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git
            repositories. It is a code hosting platform for version control and
            collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from
            anywhere.Imagine working on a project at home and while you are
            away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly remember the solution
            to a code error that has kept you restless for days. You cannot make
            these changes because your PC is not with you. But if you have your
            project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project
            with a command on whatever computer you have access to. Then you can
            make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform.
            Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to
            collaborate with other developers from any location.

            In order to use git, you should first install git. Git is easily
            available on the internet.You can download it for your operating
            system from the options given.

          <h3>How to configure a git</h3>
          <p>
            After you install git, the next thing you'll need to do is to set
            your username and email address on the command line or command
            interface. Git will use this information to identify who made
            specific changes to files.
          </p>
          <p>
            To set your username, type and execute these commands:
            <code> git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME" </code> and
            <code>git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL".</code>Just make
            sure to replace <code>"YOUR_USERNAME"</code> and
            <code>"YOUR_EMAIL"</code> with the values you choose.

          <h3>How to create and initialize a project in git</h3>
          <p>
            First to create a project I would like to suggest you to download
            Visual Studio Code in your desktop.It is a code editor which has an
            inbuilt terminal for executing commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing VS Code, open your project in the editor and open a
            new terminal for your project. This automatically points the
            terminal/command line to your project's path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now to initialize your project, simply run
            <code> git init. </code>This will tell Git to get ready to start
            watching your files for every change that occurs. It looks like
            this:
