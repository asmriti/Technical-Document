              Git and GitHub are two technologies that every developer should
              learn, irrespective of their field.Git is a version control system
              that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are not limited to using Git just for source code files you
              can also use it to keep track of text files or even images. This
              means that Git is not just for developers anyone can find it
              helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git
              repositories. It is a code hosting platform for version control
              and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on
              projects from anywhere.Imagine working on a project at home and
              while you are away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly
              remember the solution to a code error that has kept you restless
              for days. You cannot make these changes because your PC is not
              with you. But if you have your project hosted on GitHub, you can
              access and download that project with a command on whatever
              computer you have access to. Then you can make your changes and
              push the latest version back to GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform.
              Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to
              collaborate with other developers from any location.

              In order to use git, you should first install git. Git is easily
              available on the internet.You can download it for your operating
              system from the options given.

            <p>
              After you install git, the next thing you'll need to do is to set
              your username and email address on the command line or command
              interface. Git will use this information to identify who made
              specific changes to files.
            </p>
            <p>To set your username, type and execute these commands:</p>

            <div class="codes">
              <code>
                <span>git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME" </span>
                <span> git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL".</span>
              </code>
            </div>
          </article>
        </section>

        <section

        >
          <header>How to create and initialize a project in git</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              First to create a project I would like to suggest you to download
              Visual Studio Code in your desktop.It is a code editor which has
              an inbuilt terminal for executing commands.
            </p>
            <p>
              After installing VS Code, open your project in the editor and open
              a new terminal for your project. This automatically points the
              terminal/command line to your project's path.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now to initialize your project, simply run
              <code> git init. </code>This will tell Git to get ready to start
              watching your files for every change that occurs. It looks like
              this:
            </p>
            <div class="gitinit">
              <img src="img/Screenshot_47.png" alt="gitinit" />
            </div>

            <p>
              The first line has information about my PC and the path to where
              the folder exists and also the command <code> git init </code> ,
              and the second line is the response sent back telling me that my
              repository (repo) has been initialized. It is considered empty
              because we have not told Git what files to track.

          <header>How to push a repository to GitHub</header>
          <article>
            <div class="steps">
              <h4>Step 1: Create a Github account</h4>
              <p>You need to create a account of Github first.</p>
              <h4>Step 2: Create a repository</h4>
              <p>
                You can click on the <code>+</code> sign on the top corner and
                then choose on the "New repository". Give your repo a name and
                click on the "Create a repository" button.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 3:Adding and Committing files</h4>
              <p>
                <b>Add files:</b>
                When we first initialized our project, the file was not being
                tracked by Git. To do that, we use this command
                <code>git add .</code>To know what state your file is in, you
                can run the <code> git status </code> command.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Commit files:</b>To commit our file, we use the
                <code>git commit -m "first commit"</code> command.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 4:Push the repository to github</h4>
              <p>
                After you create the repo, you should be redirected to a page
                that tells you how to create a repo locally or push an existing
                one.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our case, the project already exists locally so we will use
                commands in the "â€¦or push an existing repository from the
                command line" section. These are the commands:
              </p>
              <div class="block">
                <code>
                  <span>git add README.md </span>
                  <span> git commit -m "first commit" </span>
                  <span> git branch -M main </span>
                  <span>
                    git remote add origin https://github.com/asmriti/hi.git
                  </span>
                  <span>git push -u origin main </span>
                </code>
              </div>
              <h4>Step 5: To add</h4>
              <p>
                After we make changes to the file, we again need to add the file
                to our existing repository. So for that, again on the command
                interface we need to command the following:
              </p>
              <code>
                <span>git add .</span>
                <span>git commit -m "Initial Commit"</span>
                <span>git push origin main</span>
              </code>
            </div>
